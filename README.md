This project is a collection of artifacts associated with reading and working through the exercises in Abelson & Sussman's [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).  This book is frequently cited as an exemplary introductory computer science text, and was used for years in [MIT Course 6.001](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/).  Videos of Abelson & Sussman's lectures can be found [here](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/).
